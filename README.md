# Coding Challenge (Configuration)
Hi! If you're reading this, it's because you've been invited to take 
a coding challenge for an engineering role at Divido.

This assessment is focused around writing a parser for configuration 
files.

Weâ€™ve outlined our evaluation criteria below, please consider these when 
preparing yourself to complete the assessment. We favour accuracy over 
speed, but for reference this assessment should take around 2-3 hours, 
depending on your level and experience. 

Once you've completed the challenge, please send your code to your HR 
representative; you may provide it either as a link to a repository on 
GitHub (preferred), or as a ZIP file.


## Scenario

For our (fictional) application to work correctly, we need to
be able to load one or more configuration files from disk and
merge them together. We have the following requirements:

1. It must be possible to specify multiple configuration files
   to be loaded, and have later files override settings
   in earlier ones.

2. It must be possible to retrieve parts of the configuration
   by a dot-separated path; this should work for both sections
   and for individual keys, no matter how deeply nested.
   
So, for the following configuration file:
```json
{
  "environment": "production",
  "database": {
    "host": "mysql",
    "port": 3306,
    "username": "divido",
    "password": "divido"
  },
  "cache": {
    "redis": {
      "host": "redis",
      "port": 6379
    }
  }
}
```

The key `database.host` should return the string `mysql` and the key `cache` should return the entire contents of the `cache` property.
You can return nested values in whatever is appropriate for your application (eg: `arrays` for PHP, `list` or `tupple` for Python, etc).


The assesment is based on a real live example that you might have to work on at Divido, there are no trick questions or hidden expectations.

It is really just that, load JSON files, fetch values using a dot-separated path and write tests!

You do not have to create an API or a front end, a properly tested class or classes is enough

## Notes

1. All of the configuration files your code will process will
   be in JSON format.

2. Your code must be able to detect invalid JSON, and reject
   those configuration files. This should be explicitly handled
   (eg: do not let the error bubble up).

3. Although there are libraries available for parsing configuration
   files in the way that we describe, we expect you not to use them;
   that would be defeating the purpose of this test. You may use a
   library to parse JSON, but not to fetch the data using the
   dot-separated path.

4. Bonus points if you think ahead and the system you create is easily extensible to support different file types

5. For even extra points dockerize the system 

7. You do not need to provide an UI, your code, tests and instructions
   on how to use the configuration library are enough.

We have supplied example configuration files (in the `fixtures`
folder) which your code should be able to handle.

## Assessment Criteria

You may use any language or framework of your choice to complete this
assessment. Whatever your choice, we will use the following assessment
criteria:

1. **Clean code**: we value readability and separation of concerns. Make
   your code as simple as it can possibly be, but no simpler than that.

2. **Unit tests**: we value testing; you should demonstrate that you
   understand the fundamentals of how to test your application, and be
   able to suggest ways in which the testing could be improved. We will
   assess both your code, and the tests.

3. **Idiomatic code**: all languages have their own community standards;
   you should be aware of these, and be able to write code that meets those
   standards. For example, the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) format for PHP.

4. **Documentation**: the ability to write clear and concise documentation
   is a skill in and of itself; feel free to provide an expanded `README`
   file with instructions on how to run your application. Use code comments
   liberally, and explain the _why_, not the _what_.

5. **Clean commit history**: one of the best ways for us to understand how
   you think is to see how you approached the problem. Commit early and often;
   don't be afraid to use multiple branches and make changes as you go.
   Logical, understandable commit messages are a bonus.

# Good Luck!

#How to run my application
1. Install php  Xampp sever
2. Copy my code into the htdocs folder in the Xampp server
3. once the coping is completed, click on this link "http://localhost/config-chg-main/"
4. Finally the result is displayed.
